# Bootstrap-Portfolio
This is a portfolio website for Hadi Yousufi. Rather than creating the layout manually via HTML, Bootstrap was used via the cosmo Bootstrap theme to create the essetial structure. Various Bootstrap elements suchs as the navbar, jumbotron, contact form, etc. were handpicked and implemented into the theme. Main content areas were implemented using the Bootstrap Grid system.
