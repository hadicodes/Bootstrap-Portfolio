# Bootstrap-Portfolio

### Update (April 13, 2017) this is an earlier project. For my most current porfolio, please check out http://hadiyousufi.com/

This is a portfolio website for Hadi Yousufi. Rather than creating the layout manually via HTML, Bootstrap was used via the cosmo Bootstrap theme to create the essetial structure. Various Bootstrap elements suchs as the navbar, jumbotron, contact form, etc. were handpicked and implemented into the theme. Main content areas were implemented using the Bootstrap Grid system.

Final Layout changes added to Bootsrap-Portfolio
CSS cleaned up and commented for clarity during review
Add JS animation to submit button for bonus
